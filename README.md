React-Express-Docker-Card-Game
This is a basic React app that works alongside the Express framework and can be run on Docker. It uses two APIs: [Deck of Cards API] and [Zippopotam.us API]. The app allows you to draw a random card from a deck and display it on the screen, along with a welcome message based on the Las Vegas zip code. üé∞

Features
Create and reference a deck of cards: The app uses the Deck of Cards API to create a shuffled deck of 52 cards and draw a random card from it. You can see the card code, value, suit, and image on the screen. üÉè
Display a welcome message: The app uses the Zippopotam.us API to get the city name and state abbreviation for the Las Vegas zip code (89109). It then displays a welcome message to the user, such as ‚ÄúWelcome to Las Vegas, NV!‚Äù üåÜ
Run on Docker: The app includes two Docker files and a YAML file to establish the connections and ports needed to run it on Docker. It is based on a Linux Alpine installation, making it lightweight. üê≥
Installation
To run the app on Docker, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project folder and run docker-compose up to build and run the app.
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.
Future Plans
I‚Äôd like to develop this app further and turn it into a blackjack game that can be hosted online with Docker and allow people to play it from their own machine. I think it would be a fun and challenging project to work on. ‚ô†Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
